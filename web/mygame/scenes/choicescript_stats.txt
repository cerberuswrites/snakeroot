[b]Monsters.[/b] The creatures outside the walls. There's the run-of-the-mill kinds, of course, but these are different. Rotting. Festering. Different people call them different things — some call them outside, some call them aberrations, some call them a price to pay for some ancient sin. What sin, you don't know, but you do know this: these creatures were made, not born.

[b]The Rot.[/b] The phenomenon that started 20 years ago, resulting in drastic changes in the use of magic and the rise of strange beasts. The monsters that arise from this seem to be capable of spreading its corruption — it seeps into the land around them, and into people, if not careful.

[b]Magic.[/b] One of the major sources of power in this world, integrated and co-existing alongside modern technology. Present in all, easy to use, and difficult to master. All magic has a price, and what is not offered, is taken. The Rot changed the way that magic operated — individuals without magic prior to its onset began to develop unknown abilities, while existing magical structures struggled to maintain integrity.

[b]The Vanguard.[/b] The company that you work for. They specialise in most, if not all, things monster-related: locating, researching, and exterminating. Of course, they're best known for the last of those.

[b]Field Agents.[/b] The main operatives of the Vanguard, who take on any job that the Vanguard leaders send their way. Some people prefer to take on specialties within this job, yourself included, hence your title: hunter.

[b]Chimaeras.[/b] A humanoid creature with a set of horns and a tail. They are descended from 'outsiders' such as elementals and demons, and as a result, are typically known to have an affinity for with elemental magic.

[b]Merfolk.[/b] A predominantly aquatic species, capable of existing on land through a particularly painful shapeshifting experience. Most tend to stick to one habitat or another for this reason. Merfolk that possess an ability to hypnotise with their voice are known as Sirens.

[b]Shifters.[/b] A shapeshifting humanoid capable of assuming an animalistic form at will. Known for their curious markings that often resemble their alternate form, most shifters display related traits even when in their humanoid form. Canine shifters, for instance, possess a heightened sense of smell even when not shapeshifted.

[b]Humans.[/b] The most populous species still. They're adaptable and resilient, and can be found in almost every settlement that still stands.

[b]Sorcerers.[/b] A class of humanoid that is capable of performing powerful acts of magic. True sorcerers are rare, especially in the aftermath of the Rot.

[b]Salamanders.[/b] A magical beast that resembles a dragon without wings. Adult salamanders are capable of breathing fire, and range anywhere between four to five metres in length.
